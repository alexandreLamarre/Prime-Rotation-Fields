# Prime-Rotation-Fields

An app that visualizes the rotation of the number line at each prime intersection. The app can be accessed [here]().

The color gradient depicts where the rotations start by sharp colors and depicts where the rotations end by dull colors.

Starting at origin, with the line containg all the points ranging from 0 to 1,000,000 rotating by 90 degrees gives:
